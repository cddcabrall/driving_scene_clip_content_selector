Software for selecting a video clip from an annotated library of driving video scenes. A total of 38,298 seconds of driving footage were annotated for their contents by around 200 crowdworkers from 46 countries. Users can get a short driving video clip (dash-cam view) with different specified contents. Users can select for different kinds of road users (cars, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, etc.), road/infrastructure features (curved roads, single lane, with signage, etc.) and behavioral aspects (lane changes, turning on/off the road, slowing down, etc.). Segments can be saved to a user specified location as an .avi video file. The segments are parsed from s\from 49 source video files (v01.avi, v02.avi, etc.) and are available online via youtube (search for user "Christopher Cabrall" and the playlist "Driving Scene Content Clips") An example for v14.avi is found at https://youtu.be/8QpGg6or7Iw
